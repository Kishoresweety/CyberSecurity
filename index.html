<!-- Beginner -->
<div class="section-title">Beginner – Networking Basics</div>
<div class="grid">

<div class="card"><h3>Client–Server Model</h3><p>This is the standard architecture of the internet.<br>
The Concept: One computer (the Client) makes a request, and another computer (the Server) fulfills it.<br>
Analogy: A customer (Client) ordering food at a restaurant, and the kitchen (Server) preparing and serving it.</p><a href="01_client_server.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>DNS Resolution</h3><p>The Concept: Computers communicate using numbers (IP addresses), but humans use names (like https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com). DNS translates the human-readable domain name into the machine-readable IP address.<br>
Analogy: The "Phonebook" of the internet. You look up a name (website) to find their phone number (IP address).</p><a href="02_dns.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>HTTP vs HTTPS</h3><p>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Transmits data in plain text. If intercepted, anyone can read it.<br>
HTTPS (S - Secure): Encrypts the data using TLS/SSL. If intercepted, it looks like gibberish.<br>
Key Difference: HTTP is like sending a postcard (readable by anyone); HTTPS is like sending a sealed, locked briefcase.</p><a href="03_http_https.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>IP Address & Ports</h3><p>IP Address: The unique address that identifies a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).<br>
Port: A specific docking point on that device for a specific service (e.g., Web traffic usually uses Port 80 or 443).<br>
Analogy: The IP address is the Street Address of a building. The Port is the specific Apartment Number inside that building.</p><a href="04_ip_ports.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>TCP vs UDP</h3><p>Feature TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):<br>The "Reliable Delivery" Method
TCP is like sending a Registered Letter. You get a receipt confirming it arrived, and if it gets lost, the post office sends it again.
Connection-Oriented: It performs a "Three-Way Handshake" (Hello? -> Hi! -> Okay, let's talk) before sending any data.
Guaranteed Delivery: If a piece of data (packet) is lost, TCP notices and resends it.
Ordered: It ensures data arrives in the exact order it was sent (1, 2, 3...).
Use Case: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP), and File Transfers (FTP). You wouldn't want an email to arrive with missing words!<br>UDP (User Datagram Protocol):<br>The "Fire and Forget" Method
UDP is like a Live Radio Broadcast. The station sends the signal out; if you miss a second of audio because of static, the station doesn't stop and replay it for you—it just keeps going.  
Connectionless: No handshake. It just starts "firing" data at the destination immediately.  
No Guarantees: If a packet is lost, it's gone forever. There is no retransmission.  
Faster: Because it doesn't check for errors or wait for receipts, it is much faster and "lighter" than TCP.  
Use Case: Online gaming, Live streaming, and Video calls (Zoom/Teams). It’s better to have a tiny glitch in a video call than for the whole call to freeze while it waits for a "lost" frame.

<div class="card"><h3>Firewalls</h3><p>The Concept: A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.<br>Analogy: A security guard at a gated community who checks every car's ID against a list of allowed visitors before letting them in.</p><a href="06_firewalls.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Encryption</h3><p>The Concept: The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.<br>
Symmetric: Uses one key to lock and unlock.<br>
Asymmetric: Uses a Public Key to lock (encrypt) and a Private Key to unlock (decrypt).</p><a href="07_encryption.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Authentication vs Authorization</h3><p>Authentication (Who are you?): Verifying identity (e.g., Logging in with a password).<br>
Authorization (What can you do?): Verifying permissions (e.g., A regular user vs. an Admin).</p><a href="08_auth.html">Open</a></div>

</div>

<!-- Intermediate -->
<div class="section-title">Intermediate – Attacks</div>
<div class="grid">

<div class="card"><h3>MITM Attack</h3><p>The Concept: An attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.<br>
Scenario: You connect to a fake public Wi-Fi named "Free Coffee". The hacker controls the router and sees everything you send to the bank.</p><a href="09_mitm.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Phishing</h3><p>The Concept: A social engineering attack used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers.<br>
Mechanism: Usually occurs via email, masquerading as a trusted entity (e.g., "Urgent: Reset your Bank Password").</p><a href="10_phishing.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>SQL Injection</h3><p>The Concept: An attacker interferes with the queries an application makes to its database.<br>Mechanism: Typing malicious code into a login box (like ' OR 1=1 --) to trick the database into revealing information or logging the attacker in without a password.</p><a href="11_sql_injection.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>XSS</h3><p>The Concept: Attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites viewed by other users.<br>
Mechanism: Posting a comment on a blog that contains invisible JavaScript. When others view the comment, their browser executes the script, potentially stealing their session cookies.</p><a href="12_xss.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>CSRF</h3><p>The Concept: An attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated.<br>
Scenario: You are logged into your bank. You click a link in a spam email. That link secretly tells your browser to send a "Transfer Money" request to the bank, and the bank accepts it because you are logged in.</p><a href="13_csrf.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Brute Force</h3><p>The Concept: A trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN).<br>
Mechanism: Trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.</p><a href="14_bruteforce.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Session Hijacking</h3><p>The Concept: The exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.<br>
Mechanism: Stealing the "Session Cookie" so the server thinks the attacker is you.</p><a href="15_session.html">Open</a></div>

</div>

<!-- Advanced -->
<div class="section-title">Advanced – Real World Security</div>
<div class="grid">

<div class="card"><h3>Malware Types</h3><p>Virus: Attaches to clean files and spreads.<br>
Worm: Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers.<br>
Trojan: Disguises itself as legitimate software.<br>
Ransomware: Encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock them.</p><a href="16_malware.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Botnets</h3><p>The Concept: A network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge.<br>
Use: Often used to send spam or launch DDoS attacks.</p><a href="17_botnets.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>DDoS</h3><p>The Concept: A malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target with a flood of Internet traffic from multiple sources (Botnets).</p><a href="18_ddos.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Zero-Day</h3><p>The Concept: A vulnerability in software that is unknown to the vendor. This means there is no patch available yet.<br>
The Name: The developers have had "zero days" to fix it.</p><a href="19_zeroday.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Reverse Shells</h3><p>The Concept: Standard connections are Client -> Server. In a reverse shell, the target machine (victim) is forced to initiate a connection back to the attacker.<br>
Why? This often bypasses firewalls because firewalls usually block incoming connections but allow outgoing ones.</p>.</p><a href="20_reverse_shell.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Privilege Escalation</h3><p>The Concept: Exploiting a bug or configuration oversight to gain elevated access to resources.<br>
Vertical: Going from a User to an Admin.<br>
Horizontal: Accessing another user's account of the same level.</p><a href="21_privilege.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Network Sniffing</h3><p>The Concept: Using software/hardware (like Wireshark) to capture and analyze data packets flowing through a network.</p><a href="22_sniffing.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>IDS / IPS</h3><p>Feature IDS (Intrusion Detection System):<br>
Action-Watch & Alert. Like a burglar alarm.<br>
Position-Often sits "out of band" (copy of traffic).<br>
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):<br>
Action-Watch & Stop. Like a guard dog that bites.<br>
Position-Sits "in-line" (traffic flows through it).</p><a href="23_ids_ips.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>VPN & Tor</h3><p>VPN (Virtual Private Network): Creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your data, hiding your IP address from the destination.<br>Tor (The Onion Router): Reroutes traffic through multiple volunteer nodes, stripping data at each layer for high anonymity.</p>.</p><a href="24_vpn_tor.html">Open</a></div>

<div class="card"><h3>Real-World Attack Chain</h3><p>Attacks rarely happen in isolation. They follow a chain:<br>
Reconnaissance: Gathering info (Sniffing, Phishin><br>
Weaponization: Creating the malware (Trojan).<br>
Delivery: Sending it to the victim (Email).<br>
Exploitation: Triggering the bug (Zero-day).<br>
Installation: Installing the backdoor (Reverse Shell).<br>
Command & Control (C2): Taking control remotely.<br>
Actions on Objectives: Stealing data or Ransomware.</p><a href="25_attack_chain.html">Open</a></div>
